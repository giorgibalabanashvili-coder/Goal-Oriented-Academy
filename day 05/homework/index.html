<h1>computer wikipedia</h1>
<p>A computer is a machine that can be programmed 
    to automatically carry out sequences of arithmetic
     or logical operations (computation). Modern digital
      electronic computers can perform generic sets of
       operations known as programs, which enable computers
        to perform a wide range of tasks. The term computer
         system may refer to a nominally complete computer 
         that includes the hardware, operating system, 
         software, and peripheral equipment needed and 
         used for full operation; or to a group of computers
          that are linked and function together, 
    such as a computer network or computer cluster.</p>
<h1>Etymology</h1>
<p>It was not until the mid-20th century that the 
    word acquired its modern definition; according
     to the Oxford English Dictionary, the first known
      use of the word computer was in a different sense,
       in a 1613 book called The Yong Mans Gleanings by
        the English writer Richard Brathwait:
         "I haue [sic] read the truest computer of Times,
          and the best Arithmetician that euer [sic] breathed,
     and he reduceth thy dayes into a short number." </p>
<h2>History</h2>
<h3>Pre-20th century</h3>
<p>Devices have been used to aid computation for
     thousands of years, mostly using one-to-one
      correspondence with fingers. The earliest counting 
      device was most likely a form of tally stick. Later
       record keeping aids throughout the Fertile 
       Crescent included calculi (clay spheres, cones, etc.)
        which represented counts of items, likely 
        livestock or grains, sealed in hollow unbaked clay
         containers.
    [a][4] The use of counting rods is one example.</p>

<h3>Digital computers</h3>
<h4>Electromechanical</h4>
<p>Claude Shannon's 1937 master's thesis laid the
     foundations of digital computing, with his insight
      of applying Boolean algebra to the analysis and 
      synthesis of switching circuits being the basic 
      concept
     which underlies all electronic digital computers.</p>
