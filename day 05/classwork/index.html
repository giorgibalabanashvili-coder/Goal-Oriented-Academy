<h1>HTML</h1>
<p>Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) 
    is the standard markup language[a] for
     documents designed to be displayed in
      a web browser.</p>
      <h2>History</h2>
      <h3>Development</h3>
      <p>In 1980, physicist Tim Berners-Lee,
         a contractor at CERN, proposed and prototyped 
         ENQUIRE, a system for CERN researchers to use
          and share documents. In 1989, Berners-Lee wrote 
          a memo proposing an Internet-based hypertext system.
          [4] Berners-Lee specified HTML
         and wrote the browser and server software in late 
         1990.</p>
         <h2>Transition of HTML publication to WHATWG</h2>
         <p>On 28 May 2019, the W3C announced that WHATWG
             would be the sole publisher of the HTML and DOM
              standards.[66][67][68][69] The W3C and WHATWG had
               been publishing competing standards since 2012.
                While the W3C standard was identical to the WHATWG
                 in 2007 the standards have since progressively 
                 diverged due to different design decisions.[70]
                  The WHATWG "Living Standard"
             had been the de facto web standard for some time.</p>
<h4>Markup</h4>
<p>HTML markup consists of several key components,
     including those called tags (and their attributes),
      character-based data types, character references and 
      entity references.</p>
