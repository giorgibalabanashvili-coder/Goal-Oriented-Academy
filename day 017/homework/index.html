        <h2 id="home-page">Artificial intelligence (AI) 
            is the capability of computational systems to
            perform tasks typically associated with human 
            intelligence, such as learning, reasoning,
            problem-solving, perception, and decision-making.
            It is a field of research in computer 
            science that develops and studies methods 
            and software that enable machines to perceive
            their environment and use learning and
            intelligence to take actions that maximize their
            chances of achieving defined goals.</h2>

        <h1>Goals</h1>
        <h2 id="Goals">Early researchers developed algorithms 
            that imitated step-by-step reasoning 
            that humans use when they solve puzzles 
            or make logical deductions.[13] By the late 
            1980s and 1990s, methods were developed for
             dealing with uncertain or incomplete information,
             employing concepts from probability and economics.

        <h1>Planning and decision-making</h1>
        <h2 id="Planning and decision-making">An "agent" is anything that perceives and
            takes actions in the world. A rational agent
            has goals or preferences and takes actions to
            make them happen.[d][32] In automated planning, 
            the agent has a specific goal.[33] In automated 
            decision-making, the agent has preferences—there
            are some situations it would prefer to be in, 
            and some situations it is trying to avoid.

        <h1>Perception</h1>
        <h2 id="Perception">Machine perception is 
            the ability to use input 
            from sensors (such as cameras, 
            microphones, wireless signals, 
            active lidar, sonar, radar, and tactil
            sensors) to deduce aspects of the world.
            Computer vision is the ability to analyze
            visual input.
